I've decided to shift my focus away from AWS certification and fully commit to bug bounty hunting. Since I donâ€™t see AWS learning as directly related to bug bounties, I wonâ€™t be counting that time towards my bug bounty progress.

Moving forward, I'll continue working on my ARTE certification separately, but my main priority will be bug bounties. Each day, Iâ€™ll aim to read and pin three write-ups from successful bug bounty rewards.

Each day, Iâ€™ll aim to read and pin three write-ups from bug bounty rewards here. Iâ€™ll also be reading blogs/books related to bug bounty hunting / hacking to keep learning and improving my skills.
