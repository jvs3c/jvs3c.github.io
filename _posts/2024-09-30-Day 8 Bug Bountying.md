Welcome back to **Day 8** of my 100 Days of Bug Bountying journey! 🔄

Building on my previous reading, I’ve organized my approach to fully understand subdomain enumeration. I created a checklist for my tool that outlines all the essential features and techniques I want to implement. This checklist will serve as a roadmap and will be updated and improved over the coming days as I expand my knowledge and fine-tune the tool.
