Welcome back to **Day 7** of my 100 Days of Bug Bountying journey! üåç

While reading a blog on day 5 (which I caught up on today), I discovered something new‚Äî**weaponizing Favicon hashes** to find subdomains. This technique was something I hadn‚Äôt come across before, so I decided to fork the [FavFreak](https://github.com/devanshbatham/FavFreak) repository and created [my own version](https://github.com/jvs3c/FavFreak_jvs3c) of the tool to handle Favicons.

I made adjustments to the output and parsing logic, making it easier to integrate into the automated tool I started working on yesterday. This modification should allow smoother integration and enhance the overall recon process in my automation setup.
