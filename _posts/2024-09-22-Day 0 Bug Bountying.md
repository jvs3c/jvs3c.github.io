Welcome to the start of my 100 Days of Bug Bountying journey! 🎉Today, September 22nd, there are exactly 100 days left until the end of the year, for this reason I have decided to spend it on the following:  Over the next 100 days, I’ll be sharing my experiences, learning from scratch, and (fingers crossed!) evolving into a skilled and successful bug bounty hunter. Whether you're a beginner like me or already have some experience, I invite you to join me as I dive deep into the technical, tactical, and strategic sides of hunting bugs, finding vulnerabilities, reading write-ups, sharing helpful tips, and, hopefully, earning some cool bounties along the way.

Let’s start this adventure! 🐞💻 - @jvs3c

## Background

Just to give you a bit of background... I  have been working as a security analyst/penetration for around 4 years (still working). Throughout my career, I've achieved various certifications such as BSCP, OSCP or OSWE. These qualifications have given me a strong base in the field of offensive security and the testing of applications and web systems.

In my professional life, I’ve worked on several penetration tests and research into vulnerabilities. Yet, despite this experience, I've realized that I want toto enhance my skills in more advanced areas of Application Security. Although I'm quite comfortable with the basics of AppSec, which I've become proficient in over time, I'm now looking to push my skills further.

This new phase of my journey will concentrate on more advanced methods—I won't be going over the basics again. Instead, I plan to explore the more complex elements of AppSec to elevate my knowledge and skills.

## My Goal for 100 Days

By the end of these 100 days, I want to:

1.  Submit my first valid bug to a bounty platform.
2.  Gain enough experience to tackle increasingly complex bug types.
3.  Build a solid methodology for hunting bugs efficiently.
4.  Sharpen my AppSec (Application Security) skills so I can tackle any challenge that comes my way.
5.  Connect with and learn from the bug bounty community.
6.  Document this journey as a resource for anyone else who wants to dive into BB
