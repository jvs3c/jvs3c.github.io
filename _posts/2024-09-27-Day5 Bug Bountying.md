Welcome back to **Day 5** of my 100 Days of Bug Bountying journey! üîç

Yesterday, I skimmed through some material on how to get started in bug bounty hunting. My main takeaway was that the first and most important thing I need to master is effective recon. To tackle this, I‚Äôve been dedicating time to reading blogs on various recon techniques.

I've also decided that over the next days, I‚Äôm going to build an automated tool for recon and some quick vulnerability checks.

This should make the entire process much more efficient and save time in the long run.
