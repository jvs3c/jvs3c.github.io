Welcome to **Day 2** of my 100 Days of Bug Bountying journey! ðŸŽ¯ Today, I focused on **completing the remaining IAM labs** and moved forward with **STS (Security Token Service)** labs, which gave me more hands-on experience with AWS security, particularly around IAM roles and temporary security credentials.

Nothing else to add :)
